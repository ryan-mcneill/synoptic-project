# ‚ÅâÔ∏è Assumptions and Limitations

When building this project, there have been a series of assumptions made and limitations to development that I have 
documented here.

## ü§î Assumptions

- I have assumed that whatever hardware I am provided for this application can be replicated by using the `iPhone X`
compatibility mode provided in the Google Chrome browser. As such, all the design decisions and implementation relies
on these specific display dimensions being used for the hardware.


- Not knowing anything about the hardware, deployment of the application is a bit of an unknown and as such I have not 
included any specific build processes. In lieu of this however, I have assumed that whatever hardware is running will be
able to run the three servers concurrently and be accessible from another piece of software. Part of this assumption is 
that the hardware will be running a headless chromium that can interact with these servers.
