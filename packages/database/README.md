## 📝 Notes

This packages contains one single directory, the `data` folder. Technically, it's not necessary to split this into it's
own package, but for the purposes of development and using the lerna workspaces, I have done this so it can be run in
parallel with other lerna processes. 

In phase two of the project, this should be looked into to find a better solution. Possibly merging in with the server 
package.
